		<p>Sunflower
When it blooms: Late summer to early fall
Why we love them: They're fun and come in every color and size from tiny to gigantic! Plus, they're easy to grow from seed, though you may need to protect the seeds and seedlings from birds and rodents with a chicken wire cage formed around them.</p>

		<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[5] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[6] </p>
